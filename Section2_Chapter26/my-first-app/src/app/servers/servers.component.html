<!--the servers component was created using the CLI with 'ng generate component servers' -->
<label>Server Name</label>
<!--$event is a special argument that can be used when using event binding, it gives us access to the event data-->
<!-- this is one way data binding -->
<!-- <input type="text" class="form-control"(input)="onUpdateServerName($event)"> -->

<!-- here is an even easier way to bind data on events and it is mixing event and property binding -->
<!-- Since in the TS component we gave serverName a value, you will see it in this input box -->
<!-- and if we change the input you will see the serverName property changing, 2-way binding!!! -->
<input type="text" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="serverName">


<!-- <p>{{ serverName }}</p> -->
<!--square brackets lets Angular know that you are binding a property from the TS component to this HTML element-->
<!--this is saying if allowNewServer is not true then activate the disabled attribute-->
<button class="btn btn-primary" 
    [disabled]="!allowNewServer"
    
    (click)="onCreateServer()">Add Server</button>
<!-- for event binding use the paraenthese  -->

<!--this is showing string interpolation data binding with binding to the boolean property in our TS component-->
<p>{{ allowNewServer }}</p>

<!--here is an example of replacing string interpolation with property binding-->
<!--the innerText attribute points to the value of the element-->
<p [innerText]="allowNewServer"></p>

<!-- <p>{{ serverCreationStatus }}</p> -->
<!-- using the ngIf directive we are checking the boolean value of serverCreated
    this also takes the palcve of serverCreationStatus -->
<!--the else will grab the template named noServer and display it the else is showen first because serverCreated is false until button is clicked-->
<!-- <p *ngIf="serverCreated; else noServer">Server was created, server name is {{ serverName }}</p>
<ng-template #noServer>
    <p>No server was created!</p>
</ng-template> -->

<p *ngIf="serverCreated">Server was created, server name is {{ serverName }}</p>

<!-- going to use the *ngFor directive to loop through an array and apply it to the DOM
    we are using a star in the directive because it is a structural directive -->
<app-server *ngFor="let server of servers"></app-server>
